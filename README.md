Just saw Jumbo. Wow, what the... even was that? My head's spinning like one of those old carousels, creaking and spinning... am I making sense? Sorry, Dan, it's like trying to wrangle ferrets on a caffeine sprint talking about this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮.

Popcorn -- everywhere. It's like they had a vendetta against the concept of clean theater floors. My shoes stick to the ground with every step, like walking on gum in summer. Anyway, <Jumbo> that 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 about... the carousel, yeah, it was almost like a strange dream. You left feeling you've 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed some emotions you weren't quite ready for. Childish, naivety... but heavy? Maybe like stepping in unexpected emotional quicksand.

This part where the lights from the ride whirl around felt like when you suddenly realize how deep a rabbit hole you’ve dug into – 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 some surgery videos 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 and then boom, midnight. It was shimmering, kinda like gazing at a sparkling mineral display but sentient, you know? The noises of the theater, people whispering, and the back ache coming from these seats... it's like I traded spines with a hundred-year-old tortoise.

And there was that connection... between her and the ride? What's her name... Jeanne! Yes, sorta like attempting to connect with animals who clearly understand more than they let on. Reminds me of that iguana at work who has these eyes that... seem like they’ll get up and tell you a story if you wait long enough. Jumbo felt like that, hanging on an edge of the unknown, half-understood intentions floating in midair.

>You know those moments when you forgot to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and everyone else has seen it, and you feel out of the loop? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   was almost like the opposite, being too much in the loop! It loops around you...

Did I mention the ball pit? Or was that from something else? Gosh, it's blending like the mishmash dreams you have after flipping through channels all night. It’s both annoying and endearing... Like listening to a parrot mispronounce medical terminology – it sticks somewhere between distant curiosities and close comforts.

Anyhow... oh, look at this. Code got here: 

```js
function jumboConfusion(isReal) {
  if (feelingSpun && emotions𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed) {
    return Lost in a loop;
  }
  // Seriously, what even?
  return true;
}
```
Forget that. But 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 Jumbo if you dare surf that ride. Or... Listen to it fall apart, kinda like my back after leaving.
